# Confidential P2P Micro-Lending Desk

A peer-to-peer micro-lending platform built with privacy-preserving zero-knowledge smart contracts, enabling borrowers to demonstrate eligibility and access credit while keeping their sensitive financial data confidential.

## Technology Direction

- **Midnight Network**: Privacy-first zero-knowledge blockchain foundation
- **Compact**: Smart contract programming language for zero-knowledge contracts
- **React & TypeScript**: Modern frontend interface
- **Midnight.js**: Client SDK for contract interaction and proof generation
- **Lace Wallet**: Web wallet integration for identity and transaction signing

## Status

> **Note**: This repository is currently under active development. Project structure and core modules are being initialized.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Compact Toolchain**: Installed and available in PATH (e.g. `compact 0.5.1` with compiler `0.31.1`).
- **Node.js**: Node.js v20+ and npm.

### Installation
```bash
npm install
```

### Compact Smart Contracts
The Compact contracts reside in `contracts/`.
- Compile Compact contracts to generated TypeScript and ZKIR artifacts:
  ```bash
  npm run compile:contracts
  ```
- Compile and typecheck contract bindings:
  ```bash
  npm run build:contracts
  ```

## Smart Contract Architecture (Foundational)

The initial Compact contract (`contracts/src/index.compact`) establishes the foundational state model for the lending lifecycle:

- **`LoanStatus`**:
  - `requested`: Initial state upon loan creation.
  - `funded`: Transitioned when a lender supplies capital.
  - `repaid`: Transitioned when borrower returns principal and interest.
  - `settled`: Concluding state for the loan.
- **Ledger State**:
  - `borrower`: Borrower public account key (`Bytes<32>`).
  - `lender`: Optional lender account key (`Maybe<Bytes<32>>`).
  - `amount`: Loan principal requested (`Uint<64>`).
  - `interestRateBasisPoints`: Interest rate in basis points (`Uint<16>`).
  - `durationBlocks`: Term duration in blocks (`Uint<32>`).
  - `status`: Current lifecycle state (`LoanStatus`).
- **Inspection Circuits**:
  - `getLoanStatus()`: Inspect current loan status.
  - `getLoanDetails()`: Retrieve structured `LoanDetails` record.
