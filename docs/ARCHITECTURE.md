# Architecture & Privacy Boundary Specification

This document defines the architectural foundations and privacy model of the **Confidential P2P Micro-Lending Desk** built on the Midnight Network.

---

## 1. System Overview

The platform enables peer-to-peer micro-loans using zero-knowledge smart contracts written in **Compact**. Borrowers can request capital with explicit terms, while lenders evaluate and fund matching requests based on verifiable proof of creditworthiness without exposing the borrower's private financial data.

---

## 2. Conceptual Privacy Boundary

The core design principle of this protocol is strict segregation between **public, discoverable agreement terms** and **private, confidential financial credentials**.

### 2.1 Public / Discoverable State
The following fields reside on the public Midnight ledger:

1. **`status` (`LoanStatus`)**: Current lifecycle state (`requested`, `funded`, `repaid`, `settled`). Required for coordination between borrower, lender, and protocol transitions.
2. **`amount` (`Uint<64>`)**: Principal amount requested. Required for prospective lenders to know how much liquidity to supply.
3. **`interestRateBasisPoints` (`Uint<16>`)**: Interest rate expected by the borrower / offered to lenders. Required for economic evaluation.
4. **`durationBlocks` (`Uint<32>`)**: Number of ledger blocks until repayment is due. Required for maturity timeline evaluation.
5. **`borrower` (`Bytes<32>`)**: Public account identifier / commitment of the borrower. Required so loan funds can be disbursed to the correct recipient.
6. **`lender` (`Maybe<Bytes<32>>`)**: Optional account identifier of the lender. Set to `none` initially; recorded once funded to designate repayment destination.
7. **`isEligibilityVerified` (`Boolean`)**: On-chain boolean flag recording whether the borrower has successfully executed the off-chain zero-knowledge eligibility proof.

### 2.2 Private / Local Information
The following values are strictly maintained off-chain within the borrower's private environment (wallet and witness context) and **never written to the public ledger**:

- **Actual borrower income**: Salary, wages, or recurring revenue figures.
- **Actual account / wallet balance**: Exact asset balances held by the borrower.
- **Credit ratings and credentials**: Off-chain attestation scores or debt ratios.
- **Witness values**: Secret inputs passed into zero-knowledge circuits during proof generation.
- **Cryptographic blinding factors / salts**: Nonces and blinding factors used in commitments.

## 3. What Will Eventually Be Proven Using Zero-Knowledge

In subsequent development phases, a zero-knowledge circuit will verify loan eligibility predicates:

1. **Threshold Compliance**: Proves that the borrower's private balance or income satisfies required risk thresholds (e.g., `privateBalance >= minimumRequiredCollateral` or `debtToIncomeRatio <= maxAllowedRatio`) without revealing the actual values.
2. **Commitment Binding**: Proves that the private attributes belong to the requesting borrower identity (`borrower`).
3. **Ledger Attestation**: Upon verification of the ZK proof, the on-chain contract marks `isEligibilityVerified = true`. Lenders can trust this verified indicator without needing access to any confidential data.

---

## 4. Why Sensitive Financial Values Are Not Placed on the Public Ledger

1. **Privacy Preservation & Surveillance Protection**: Financial figures published on-chain are permanently public, immutable, and susceptible to automated profiling, predatory marketing, and financial discrimination.
2. **True Confidentiality vs. Pseudo-Privacy**: Simply hashing secret figures (e.g. `hash(income)`) and claiming privacy is a pseudo-privacy anti-pattern. Hash pre-images with predictable values (e.g. standard salaries or account balances) can be trivial to brute-force or dictionary-attack. True privacy requires keeping secrets off-chain and proving mathematical properties with zero-knowledge proofs.
3. **Minimal Exposure Principle**: Lenders do not need to know *how much money a borrower makes*; they only need mathematical assurance that the borrower *satisfies the underwriting criteria for the requested amount*.
